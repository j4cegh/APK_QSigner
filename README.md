# Requirements
Funnily enough, this app is not made in Java, though, you would need Java to run it.
So, the requirements are:
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
* [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48), which is *most likely* already installed if you run Windows 10.<br/><br/>
#### And... that's basically it!
